## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Can't Add Vacations/Holidays?**
**Problem**: Backend connection issues or missing MongoDB setup
**Solutions**: 
1. **Use Local Backend**: `cd leave-tracking-backend && npm start` (Recommended for development)
2. **Check MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB connection string is set in `.env` file
3. **Check Ports**: Ensure ports 8000 (backend) and 3000 (frontend) are available
4. **Use Startup Script**: Run `./start-app.sh` from the root directory

### **Backend Deployment Issues?**
**Problem**: Vercel backend failing with MongoDB connection errors
**Solution**: 
- **Use Render Backend** - Better for persistent MongoDB connections
- **MongoDB Atlas** - Cloud database works perfectly with Render
- **Free Hosting** - Render provides free tier for backend hosting

### **Why Not Vercel Backend?**
- ❌ **Serverless Limitations** - Cold starts, connection timeouts
- ❌ **MongoDB Issues** - Connection pooling problems in serverless environment
- ❌ **Multi-User Support** - Not ideal for 10-20 concurrent users
- ✅ **Render Alternative** - Persistent connections, better MongoDB support

### **API Connection Issues**
- **Frontend**: Runs on localhost:3000
- **Backend**: Runs on localhost:8000
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (cloud) - FULLY WORKING ✅
- **Status**: Both servers need to be running locally for full functionality

### **Quick Fix Steps**
1. Create `.env` file in `leave-tracking-backend/` directory with your MongoDB connection string
2. Run `./start-app.sh` from the root directory
3. Or manually start both servers in separate terminals
